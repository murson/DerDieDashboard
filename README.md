A dashboard exploring the link between the endings of German nouns and their genders.

## Why...

Learning German is hard, and this is largely due to the fact that every noun has a 'gender', which has a massive impact on meaning. This is largely due to German's case system, wherein articles and adjectives morph according to the case (subject, direct, direct object, or possessive) of the noun being referred to. To better understand this, [here's a brilliant guide](https://germanwithlaura.com/noun-cases/).

Many online resources refer to specific noun-endings that are linked to specific genders, however these links are not 100% consistent, and often these resources don't disclose exactly how many words the endings may be applicable to, what the exceptions are, etc. 

Since I am a data nerd, I like to know the following about ending-gender relationships:
>1. Which endings are linked to which genders?
>2. What is the error rate of assuming certain gender-ending relationships?
>3. What are some notable exceptions to these relationships?
>4. How can you get maximum word coverage with the fewest possible endings?

The way my brain works, once I see the numbers, things tend to stick. Since I feel that I'm not alone in this, I thought I'd share my project so others can benefit too, and maybe make some suggestions about how I can improve it.
